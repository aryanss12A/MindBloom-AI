# MindBloom-AI

üß† MindBloom AI - Create Your Calm
A prototype developed for the GenAI Exchange Hackathon, focused on leveraging generative AI for youth mental wellness. MindBloom AI is a serverless web application designed as a safe, anonymous, and creative space for youth to navigate their emotional landscape. It turns mental wellness into an empowering act of creation, helping users express and understand their feelings through AI-generated art, stories, and sound.

‚ú® The Challenge
In a world of constant pressure, today's youth face significant challenges to their mental well-being. Many hesitate to seek help due to stigma, lack of access, or discomfort with traditional talk therapy. There is a critical need for accessible, engaging, and non-judgmental first-step tools for mental wellness.

üí° Our Solution: Creative-First Wellness
MindBloom AI addresses this challenge by providing a unique, creation-based approach. Our core belief is that expressing complex emotions through art, collaborative storytelling, and sound can be profoundly therapeutic. Instead of just offering static content, MindBloom AI uses Google's powerful generative AI models to co-create personalized experiences in real-time, tailored to the user's emotional state.

üöÄ Features
Our prototype includes four fully functional, AI-powered wellness tools:
